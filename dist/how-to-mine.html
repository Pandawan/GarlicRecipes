For each verification a miner makes, they get a small amount of newly created Garlicoin for their &quot;hard&quot; work.<br>You can learn more about how blockchain works <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4">here</a>.<br><br></p><p>Miners can only use their CPU (Processor) and GPU (Graphics Card) to mine Garlicoin as it is ASIC resistant; meaning that it will try to block mining on mining-specific hardware.</p><h1 id="mining-on-the-test-net">Mining on the Test-Net</h1><p>Because Garlicoin is still in development, only the Test-Net is available. This Network is intended for testing purposes only and any and all transactions which happen on it will be reset when the Main-Net is released.<br>Mining on the Test-Net is not recommended because it has no value (since everything will be reset); therefore, you should follow the Mining guide to get setup and stop mining as soon as you get it working.</p><h1 id="cpu-vs-gpu">CPU vs GPU</h1><p>Miners can use either their CPU (processor) or GPU (graphics card) to mine Garlicoin (since Garlicoin is ASIC resistant, those are the only two options).<br>Mining on the CPU is more accessible and easier to setup, but mining on the GPU is much faster and will yield to better results; It is therefore recommended to mine on the GPU (if available). It should be noted that mining on a laptop is not recommended (although feasible), because laptops are much less powerful and could get damaged much more easily.</p><h1 id="solo-vs-pool">Solo vs Pool</h1><p>When mining, whoever succesfully verifies (or mines) a block first gets the reward for mining it.<br><br></p><p>Solo mining is when a miner tries to mine by themselves; this can lead to a much higher block reward than pool mining (because the reward isn&#39;t shared), but is much more difficult because others might be able to mine faster and the Solo miner will never be able to mine one before everyone else.<br><br></p><p>Pool mining is when multiple miners get together and mine as a group (called a pool). This group is able to mine much more efficiently, which might lead to a higher success rate (and therefore reward) to its miners. Because pools are groups of miners, when they reach a reward, it is distributed to everybody based on how much they contributed (meaning a much lower reward than with solo mining). Some pools might also have a pooling fee, which are usually used by the owner to pay for their pool&#39;s hosting cost.<br><br></p><p><strong>Not everybody should use the same pool</strong>. If a pool dominates (controls at least 51% of all the mining power), it means that they have full control over the blockchain and can therefore cheat the system by modifying some of the values (essentially creating, stealing, or removing money). As a result, pool diversity is very important and people should try to find the best pool or independent ones, to solidify the network.</p><h1 id="start-mining">Start Mining</h1><p>If you wish to start mining, you can go back to the Mining menu and select whichever option you wish.</p></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="content"><p id="footer-copyright"> All articles Â© the original author and contributors, and licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0 license</a>.</p><p id="footer-github"> You can help contribute to this site on <a href="https://github.com/PandawanFr/GarlicoinHelp">GitHub</a>.</p><p id="footer-credits"> <strong>Garlic Recipes</strong> by <a href="http://pandawan.xyz/credits.html">Pandawan</a>.</p><p id="footer-donate"><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Please donate to support this project.<ul class="donate-list"><li>BCH: 1PidoMufaqTyFMgdn37Gf4fCHf1GAKZT8w</li><li>LTC: LKFQvj3c7f3unAmqLdUqfVKrd12y3nUUfH</li><li>GRLC: Not Yet</li></ul></p></div></div></footer><script src="js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
