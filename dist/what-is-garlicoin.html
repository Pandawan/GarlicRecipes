They are usually composed of two keys (long strings of data), one private and one public. The public key is used to receive Garlicoin; give that address to anyone who wishes to send them Garlicoin. The private key is used for people to send Garlicoin; keep that address secret because it gives access to all your Garlicoins. Usually, the private key will be hidden and is stored in a secret place (which only the owner should have access).<br><br></p><p>As long as the owner knows his private key and other identifying information, they can use their wallet anywhere (on any computer). <strong>Garlicoin are not stored in a file</strong>, they are just kept track of by everyone on the network. That means that deleting a Garlicoin installation will not remove any Garlicoin. The owner just needs the private key (usually stored in a <code>wallet.dat</code> file).</p><h1 id="mining">Mining</h1><p>Mining, in cryptocurrency, is the process of verifying that a transaction is valid using computer calculations. For each verification a miner makes, they get a small amount of newly created Garlicoin for their &quot;hard&quot; work.<br>You can learn more about how blockchain works <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4">here</a>. Miners can only use their CPU (Processor) and GPU (Graphics Card) to mine Garlicoin as it is ASIC resistant; meaning that it will try to block mining on mining-specific hardware.</p></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="content"><p id="footer-copyright"> All articles © the original author and contributors, and licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0 license</a>.</p><p id="footer-github"> You can help contribute to this site on <a href="https://github.com/PandawanFr/GarlicoinHelp">GitHub</a>.</p><p id="footer-credits"> <strong>Garlic Helper</strong> by <a href="http://pandawan.xyz/credits.html">Pandawan</a>.</p></div></div></footer><script src="js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
