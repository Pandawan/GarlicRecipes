### Warning: CPU Mining isn't recommended as the likeliness of mining a block with it is very low. Try GPU mining instead.

# Windows
Make sure that you have already setup a wallet and that your network is running correctly! You can check out the [Windows Wallet Guide](wallet-win.html) to learn more.

## Step 1: Downloading the Files
First you will need to dowload the CPU miner files [here](ROOT/files/miner-cpu-win.zip).  
Extract the files in your installation folder (if you have followed the wallet guides it should be `C:\Garlic\`).

## Step 2: Set Up
This miner uses a different system for different types of CPUs. Follow the section for your own CPU.  
If you own an Intel i7, the instructions are different than for other Intel CPUs.

### Intel (regular) CPU
Edit the `Run-Miner-Solo-CPU.bat` file (Right Click > Edit), make sure that at the start of the file it says `.\Miner\cpuminer-gw64-core2`.  
Also, change the address (`ADDRESS`) after `--coinbase-addr=` to whatever you Garlicoin address is.

### Intel i7 CPU
Edit the `Run-Miner-Solo-CPU.bat` file (Right Click > Edit), and change the start of the file to `.\Miner\cpuminer-gw64-corei7` (**make sure it says corei7**).  
Also, change the address (`ADDRESS`) after `--coinbase-addr=` to whatever you Garlicoin address is.  
*If mining does not work, consider following the regular Intel steps instead.*

### AMD CPU
Edit the `Run-Miner-Solo-CPU.bat` file (Right Click > Edit), and change the start of the file to `.\Miner\cpuminer-gw64-avx2` (**make sure it says avx2**).  
Also, change the address (`ADDRESS`) after `--coinbase-addr=` to whatever you Garlicoin address is.  
*If mining does not work, consider following the regular Intel steps instead.*

## Step 3: Starting the Network
From the Wallet guide, make sure that you have your network running. (You can do so by running `Run-Network.bat` if you haven't already).  

## Step 4: (Optional) Using a Pool
If you wish to use a pool instead of solo mining (you can learn more about the difference [here](how-to-mine.html#solo-vs-pool)), then follow these steps.  
<br>

Edit the `Run-Miner-Pool-CPU.bat` file (Right Click > Edit), and follow the same steps as [Step 2](#step-2-set-up) (only this time, there won't be a `--coinbase-addr`).  
Then, replace the `POOL` to the pool's address (you can find some available pools [here](pool-mining.html#main-net)).  
Once that is done, replace the `ADDRESS` (which is right after `-u`) to your address.

<br>

You can now mine using a pool. Simply run your `Run-Miner-Pool-CPU.bat` and you should be good to go.  
If the console returns something like *[2018-01-06 23:00:23] accepted: 4/4 (diff 0.000), 82.67 kH/s yes!* then you have mined a block! 

# Mac
Mac guides are currently not available. If you wish to contribute to this site, please create a pull request [here](https://github.com/PandawanFr/GarlicoinHelp/pulls).  
For now, you can follow [this guide](https://pastebin.com/p1RksRwb) by `@Vilsol#2060`, which should get you going (although it is not as detailed as a normal guide). 

# Linux

## Step 1: Download and build cpuminer-multi
Clone from the [project Github repo](https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi) into a directory of your choice. Following the instructions in the project's README, run `./build.sh` in the new directory, and install any prerequisites as specified by your environment. 

## Step 2: Run the Miner

### Step 2a: Run the Miner on a Pool
You'll need to specify the pool address, your wallet, and the algorithm:
`./cpuminer --algo=scrypt:4096 -o stratum+tcp://pool.grlc-bakery.fun:3333 -u  <your wallet address here>`
This uses the following pool: `grlc-bakery.fun`, you can check out a list of pools [here](pool-mining.html#main-net)

### Step 2b: Run the Miner Solo
While running a node locally, you'll specify your node's address, your wallet, and the algorithm:
`./cpuminer --algo=scrypt:4096 -o 127.0.0.1:42070 -u  <your wallet address here>`

You're should now see your hashrate and, eventually, confirmed blocks.

If you are trying to Solo mine, make sure that your network is running! You can check out how to set it up on the wallet guides:
- [Windows](./wallet-win.html)
- [Mac](./wallet-mac.html)
- [Linux](./wallet-nix.html)
