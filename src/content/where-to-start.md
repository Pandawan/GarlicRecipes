## Step 1: Learn
First, you might want to learn more about Garlicoin, which you can do [here](./what-is-garlicoin.html).  

## Step 2: Wallet
Once you have done that, you will want to get a Wallet (so you can have your own GRLC).  
It is **recommended** that you get the [Electrum wallet](./wallet-electrum.html), a user-friendly GUI app that you can download.  
**If you plan on solo mining**, you should get one of the official wallets (Command Only).  
- [Windows](./wallet-win.html)
- [Mac](./wallet-mac.html)
- [Linux](./wallet-nix.html)

There is also an [online wallet](https://breadbox.xyz), which is easier to use, and works anywhere. But it doesn't support Solo Mining very well, and is a bit less secure (because it's online).

## Step 3: Mining
If you want to mine, you need to learn more about the different choices you will have to make when mining, you can do so [here](./how-to-mine.html).  
Once you know what you want to do (CPU vs GPU, Solo vs Pool), then you can choose its corresponding guide.  
**GPU Pool Mining is recommended** as it has the highest success rate.
- [CPU (all)](./mining-cpu.html)
- [Windows Nvidia](./mining-win-nvidia.html)
- [Windows AMD](./mining-win-amd.html)
- [Linux GPU](./mining-nix-gpu.html)
