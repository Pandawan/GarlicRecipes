## Step 1: Learn

First, you might want to learn more about Garlicoin, which you can do [here](./what-is-garlicoin.html).

## Step 2: Wallet

Once you have done that, you will want to get a Wallet (so you can have your own GRLC).  
We officially support two types wallets: Core and Garlium.

- Core is more secure and allows for any type of mining, but takes longer to load the blockchain and uses the Command Line.
  - [Windows](./wallet-win.html)
  - [Mac](./wallet-mac.html)
  - [Linux](./wallet-nix.html)
- [Garlium](https://github.com/garlicoin-project/garlium/releases/tag/v2.0.0) is an easy to use, GUI Application, and is instant, but reduces the network security AND does not allow for solo mining.
  There are other types of wallets that you can find in the Wallet section in the navbar.

There is also an [online wallet](https://breadbox.xyz), which is easier to use, and works anywhere. But it doesn't support Solo Mining very well, and is a bit less secure (because it's online).

## Step 3: Mining

If you want to mine, you need to learn more about the different choices you will have to make when mining, you can do so [here](./how-to-mine.html).  
Once you know what you want to do (CPU vs GPU, Solo vs Pool), then you can choose its corresponding guide.  
**GPU Pool Mining is recommended** as it has the highest success rate.

- [Windows Nvidia](./mining-win-nvidia.html)
- [Windows AMD](./mining-win-amd.html)
- [Linux GPU](./mining-nix-gpu.html)
