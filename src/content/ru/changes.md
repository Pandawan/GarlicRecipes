## 1/21/18 
The Main-Net has been released. If you wish to use that instead of the Test-Net, remove any occurences of `testnet` from your commands and config files (or start the tutorials over).  
The algorithm has been changed back to `scrypt:10` for release.  

## 1/18/18
Changed scrypt from 11 to 12. If you are mining on the Test-Net, make sure that you have changed the algorithm from `scrypt:11` to `scrypt:12`.
New binaries are also available on the [download page](https://garlicoin.io/downloads).

## 1/12/18
New Fork changed scrypt from 10 to 11. If you are mining, make sure that you have changed your algorithm from `scrypt:10` to `scrypt:11`.  
New binaries were also released, you can download them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10NDfrLjVJ3K9A6xzPWCCwhrwRf6NZSk7/view).

## 1/8/18
New Fork changed scrypt to scrypt-N (scrypt:10) to combat ASIC mining. Make sure that you have changed your algorithm from `scrypt` to `scrypt:10`.
