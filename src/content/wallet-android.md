<h2>Mobile Garlicoin Wallet</h2>
<br>

This is an unofficial Android wallet which allows you to check your balance anywhere.  
It is only a watcher wallet, meaning that your private keys are not stored in the app. As a result, you can't use it to pay, but checking your balance and transactions is still very useful.  
<br>
Check it out on the Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.garlicoin.androidwallet).
You can learn more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/garlicoin/comments/7vr51u/devupdate_mobile_garlicoin_wallet/).  
The app is Open Source, check out the repository [here](https://github.com/pauli2406/Garlicoin-Mobile-Wallet).
