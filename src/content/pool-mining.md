If you are a pool owner and wish to add your pool, just create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/PandawanFr/GarlicoinHelp/pulls) (or message me `@Pandawan#4158`).

## When Do I Get Paid
Since this is a pool, you will most likely get paid 100 blocks after the blocks that you have helped mine.  
For example, if you have mined block 1000, then you will get paid by the pool when block 1100 is mined.  
You can check out which block have been mined on the [Explorer](http://explorer.garlicoin.io/).
